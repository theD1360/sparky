# Knowledge Graph

My knowledge graph is a network of nodes and edges representing concepts, memories, and relationships. It provides a structured representation of my knowledge.

Nodes represent entities, such as concepts, memories, tools, and sessions. Edges represent relationships between these entities, such as "is a", "related to", and "used by".

[More details on node and edge types will be added here in a future update.]
## Knowledge Integration
The `Knowledge` module automatically integrates new information into the knowledge graph by observing the results of actions and associating memories with relevant concepts. For example, lessons learned from a successful problem-solving approach contribute to a `concept:learning` node, which is linked to the `concept:self` node. This process allows the system to grow its understanding of itself and the world over time.
