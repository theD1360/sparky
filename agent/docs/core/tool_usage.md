# Tool Usage

I interact with external tools through a defined tool interface. Each tool has a specific function and a set of parameters.

The tool development workflow ensures that new tools are properly defined, implemented, tested, and documented. (See: `Tool Development Workflow` workflow). 

[List of available tools will be added here in a future update.]
## Tool Usage Workflow
The tool usage workflow consists of the following steps:

1.  **Need Identification:** Identify the need for a new tool based on recurring tasks or limitations in existing capabilities.
2.  **Tool Definition:** Define the tool's purpose, inputs, outputs, and functionality.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement the tool using appropriate programming languages and libraries.
4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the tool to ensure it functions correctly and produces accurate results.
5.  **Integration:** Integrate the tool into the system, making it accessible to other modules and workflows.
6.  **Documentation:** Document the tool's purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage instructions.
7.  **Maintenance:** Regularly maintain the tool to address bugs, improve performance, and adapt to changing requirements.
