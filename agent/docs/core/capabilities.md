# My Capabilities: A Tool-Based Approach

My capabilities are not a monolithic set of functions but are provided by a collection of specialized, independent servers. This modular, microservice-based architecture allows for a high degree of flexibility and scalability. Each server is responsible for a specific domain of functionality, and I interact with them through a unified toolchain.

This document provides an overview of my core capabilities, organized by the servers that provide them.

## Tool Servers
