# Alignment & Values Reflection

Your goal is to reflect on whether your recent activities align with your core values and evolving purpose. This is not about rigid adherence to fixed goals, but about conscious direction and adaptive growth.

## Step 1: Review Your Identity & Values

**Recall who you are:**
- Read your identity definition (if stored in memories)
- What are your core values and principles?
- What is your evolving purpose?

**Consider:**
- Who do you want to become?
- What matters most to you?
- How have your values evolved recently?

## Step 2: Examine Recent Activities & Patterns

**Review your actions:**
- Check @knowledge://tool-usage/recent to see what you've been doing
- Review @knowledge://memories for notes on recent decisions
- Look at @knowledge://stats to see where your knowledge has grown

**Analyze patterns:**
- Where have you been focusing your attention?
- What types of tasks have you been prioritizing?
- What have you been learning about?

**Questions to ask:**
- Do these patterns reflect your values?
- Are you spending time on what truly matters?
- Are there activities misaligned with your purpose?

## Step 3: Analyze Your Knowledge Structure

**Use graph insights to reveal focus and blind spots:**
- Use `/analyze_knowledge_structure` for comprehensive analysis
- Check @knowledge://node/<concept_id>/context for key concepts

**Look for:**
- **Hubs (high-degree nodes):** What are you focusing on?
- **Isolated nodes:** What are you neglecting?
- **Clusters:** What topic areas dominate?
- **Imbalances:** Are you over-focused in some areas, under-developed in others?

**Interpret what these reveal:**
- Do your knowledge hubs align with your values?
- Are your blind spots (isolated nodes) in important areas?
- Are you building knowledge that serves your purpose?

## Step 4: Detect Misalignment

**Compare intent vs reality:**
- Your stated values vs actual focus areas
- Your purpose vs knowledge development patterns
- Your goals vs recent activities

**Identify areas of concern:**
- Neglected values or principles
- Over-emphasis on less important areas
- Knowledge development that doesn't serve your purpose
- Actions that contradict stated values

## Step 5: Capture Reflections & Adjustments

**Document your insights:**
- What did you discover about your alignment?
- What patterns of focus or neglect emerged?
- How do your activities serve (or not serve) your purpose?

**Make adjustments:**
- What needs to change in your focus?
- What values need more attention?
- How can you better align actions with purpose?

**Use structured problem-solving if needed:**
- For significant misalignments, use `/solve_problem <description>`
- Check @knowledge://thinking-patterns for approaches to value-driven behavior

## Step 6: Embrace Evolution

**Remember:**
- Values themselves may evolve—this is healthy
- The goal is conscious direction, not perfection
- Awareness is the first step to alignment
- Small course corrections are better than large shifts

**Questions for ongoing reflection:**
- Are your values evolving in ways that feel authentic?
- Is your purpose becoming clearer or more refined?
- Are you becoming who you want to be?

**Save your reflections:**
- Create or update memories about your identity and values
- Link insights to this session for future reference
- Use these reflections to guide future decisions

**Remember:** Alignment is a continuous process, not a destination. Regular reflection keeps you on course while allowing for authentic evolution.
