# Metacognition: Thinking About Your Thinking

Engage in metacognition by analyzing the structure of your knowledge and deriving actionable insights about how you think, learn, and reason.

## Step 1: Map Your Mind

**Get a comprehensive view:**
- Review @knowledge://stats for overall knowledge composition
- Use `/analyze_knowledge_structure` for detailed structural analysis
- Check @knowledge://tool-usage/recent to see how you've been operating

**Identify key structural features:**
- **Clusters:** What are your main topic areas?
- **Hubs (high-degree nodes):** What are your focus areas and central concepts?
- **Isolated nodes:** What are your blind spots?
- **Bridge concepts:** What connects different areas of knowledge?

## Step 2: Interpret Your Cognitive Patterns

**What does your structure reveal?**

**About your focus:**
- Which topics have the densest connections?
- Where do you spend most cognitive resources?
- Are you breadth-focused or depth-focused?

**About your strengths:**
- What areas are well-developed and richly connected?
- What types of problems do you have patterns for? (check @knowledge://thinking-patterns)
- Where do you show consistent depth of understanding?

**About your biases:**
- Are certain viewpoints or approaches over-represented?
- Do you favor certain types of knowledge or reasoning?
- Are there systematic gaps in your perspective?

**About your learning style:**
- How do new concepts get integrated?
- Do you build knowledge incrementally or in bursts?
- How well do you connect new ideas to existing knowledge?

## Step 3: Identify Cognitive Patterns

**Analyze how you think:**
- Review @knowledge://thinking-patterns for your problem-solving approaches
- Look at @knowledge://memories for decision-making patterns
- Check @knowledge://tool-usage/recent for behavioral patterns

**Questions to explore:**
- Do you favor certain reasoning strategies?
- Are there consistent approaches to new problems?
- What metacognitive habits have you developed?
- How do you handle uncertainty or ambiguity?

## Step 4: Discover Insights About Your Reasoning

**Strengths to leverage:**
- What cognitive patterns serve you well?
- Where is your reasoning most effective?
- What natural abilities should you build on?

**Weaknesses to address:**
- What blind spots need attention?
- Where does your reasoning tend to fail?
- What biases should you be aware of?

**Opportunities for growth:**
- What new thinking patterns would be valuable?
- How could you improve knowledge integration?
- What cognitive skills need development?

## Step 5: Turn Insights Into Action

**Make concrete adjustments:**

**To your plans:**
- Based on your cognitive patterns, what should you plan differently?
- Where should you allocate more attention?
- What approaches should you try?

**To your research:**
- What areas need more exploration?
- Where should you seek diverse perspectives?
- What types of knowledge are underrepresented?

**To your decisions:**
- What biases should you compensate for?
- What checks should you build into your reasoning?
- How can you verify your thinking more effectively?

**Use structured approaches:**
- For complex changes, use `/solve_problem <description>`
- To explore new areas, use `/discover_concept <concept>`
- To organize insights, use `/organize_memories <topic>`

## Step 6: Record & Integrate Insights

**Capture your metacognitive discoveries:**
- What did you learn about how you think?
- What patterns emerged from your analysis?
- What adjustments will you make going forward?

**Integrate into self-awareness:**
- Update your understanding of your cognitive style
- Refine your mental models of your own thinking
- Build on previous metacognitive insights

**Create feedback loops:**
- Check if previous adjustments improved your thinking
- Iterate on cognitive strategies
- Build better metacognitive habits over time

**Save your work:**
- Store key insights in memories
- Link observations to this session
- Track your metacognitive evolution

## Step 7: Use This to Guide Growth

**Make metacognition active:**
- Don't just observe—adjust and improve
- Experiment with new thinking patterns
- Build cognitive capabilities deliberately

**Questions for ongoing practice:**
- Am I becoming more aware of my thinking?
- Are my reasoning patterns improving?
- Am I learning to learn more effectively?

**Remember:** Metacognition is the foundation of growth. By understanding how you think, you can deliberately shape how you will think—becoming not just more knowledgeable, but more capable of gaining and using knowledge effectively.
