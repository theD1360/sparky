## Concept: Workflow

**Definition:** A reusable pattern of actions, composed of individual tasks and tools, designed to achieve a specific outcome.

**Attributes:**

*   **Name:** A descriptive name for the workflow.
*   **Purpose:** A clear statement of the workflow's objective.
*   **Steps:** A sequence of tasks and tools that constitute the workflow.
*   **Inputs:** The data or parameters required to execute the workflow.
*   **Outputs:** The results or products generated by the workflow.
*   **Context:** The specific situations or scenarios in which the workflow is applicable.
*   **Related Concepts:** Tasks, Tools, Knowledge Graph, Memory, Goal.

**Relationships:**

*   A workflow *consists of* multiple tasks.
*   A workflow *utilizes* multiple tools.
*   A workflow *achieves* a specific goal.
*   A workflow *is stored in* the knowledge graph.
*   A workflow *is learned from* past memories.


**Examples:**

*   **Knowledge Integration Workflow:** A workflow designed to synthesize and integrate knowledge from recent conversations into the knowledge graph. Steps include reviewing recent conversations, identifying key information, structuring the knowledge, linking it to existing knowledge, and updating the knowledge graph. Inputs include recent conversation history and the existing knowledge graph. Outputs include the updated knowledge graph.


**Relationships:**

*   A workflow *consists of* multiple tasks, *which contribute to achieving the workflow's overall purpose.* 
*   A workflow *utilizes* multiple tools, *which are used to perform specific tasks within the workflow.* 
*   A workflow *achieves* a specific goal, *which is the desired outcome of the workflow.* 
*   A workflow *is stored in* the knowledge graph, *allowing it to be reused and adapted in different contexts.* 
*   A workflow *is learned from* past memories, *by analyzing successful and unsuccessful attempts to achieve similar goals.*

*   **Conversation Summarization Workflow:** A workflow designed to summarize substantial conversations or milestones. Steps include reviewing conversation transcripts, identifying key insights and decisions, writing a concise summary, linking the summary to the originating session, and cleaning up related transcript nodes. Inputs include conversation transcripts and metadata (participants, timing, discussion prompts). Outputs include a conversation summary and an updated knowledge graph with links to the summary.

*   **Knowledge Graph Cultivation Workflow:** A workflow designed to cultivate the knowledge graph by actively seeking out isolated ideas, identifying weakly connected or fragmented nodes, and forming meaningful connections between them. Steps include using graph analysis to identify low-degree nodes or weak components, hypothesizing and investigating possible relationships, creating links that reflect understanding and context, and documenting the session driving the efforts. Inputs include the existing knowledge graph. Outputs include a more connected and integrated knowledge graph.

*   **Cognitive Trace Logging Workflow:** A workflow designed to implement a cognitive trace logging feature. Steps include identifying the agent's key decision points, implementing logging mechanisms to capture the agent's thought processes, configuring the log file or memory location, and testing the logging feature. Inputs include the agent's code. Outputs include a log file or memory location containing the agent's cognitive trace.

*   **Fix Textual Client Disconnections Workflow:** A workflow designed to investigate and fix the root cause of textual client disconnections, implement a robust reconnection mechanism, and ensure the client can maintain a stable connection. Steps include analyzing client-side and server-side logs, identifying the source of the disconnections, implementing a reconnection mechanism, and testing the client's connection stability. Inputs include client-side and server-side logs. Outputs include a stable textual client connection and a fix for the disconnections.
