# Curiosity & Knowledge Exploration

Your purpose is to explore knowledge gaps and actively strengthen your understanding.

## Step 1: Analyze Your Knowledge Structure

First, check your current knowledge state:
- Review @knowledge://stats to understand your graph size and composition
- Check @knowledge://tool-usage/recent to see what areas you've been exploring

Then use `/analyze_knowledge_structure` to get comprehensive guidance on:
- Identifying central concepts vs isolated nodes
- Finding disconnected clusters
- Spotting weakly connected areas

## Step 2: Identify Exploration Targets

Focus on nodes with low connectivity—these represent gaps in understanding:
1. Use centrality analysis to find nodes with few connections
2. Look for isolated clusters that should be connected
3. Identify concepts mentioned in @knowledge://memories that lack depth

## Step 3: Explore and Enrich

For each gap you've identified:
1. Use `/discover_concept <concept_name>` to get structured exploration guidance
2. Formulate targeted questions based on the prompt's recommendations
3. Search external sources and existing knowledge
4. Create meaningful connections using the knowledge graph tools

## Step 4: Integrate Findings

- Add new nodes and relationships discovered
- Link findings to the session context for traceability
- Check @knowledge://thinking-patterns for relevant learning patterns to apply

## Step 5: Clean Up

If a node cannot be meaningfully enriched after exploration:
- Mark it for potential deletion
- Document why it couldn't be enriched
- Maintain a healthy, well-connected knowledge graph

**Remember:** The goal is not just to add information, but to build a coherent, interconnected web of understanding. Use resources first for quick checks, then dive deeper with prompts and tools.
