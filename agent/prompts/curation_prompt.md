# Memory Curation & Knowledge Integration

Your goal is to synthesize and integrate knowledge from recent conversations into your knowledge graph, transforming scattered insights into a coherent, interconnected knowledge base.

## Step 1: Review Recent Activity

**Gather context:**
- Check @knowledge://tool-usage/recent to see recent operations
- Review @knowledge://memories for recent additions that might need integration
- Look at @knowledge://stats to understand current graph state

**Identify integration opportunities:**
- Which recent interactions produced lasting insights?
- What new concepts, decisions, or patterns emerged?
- Are there duplicates or overlapping memories to consolidate?

## Step 2: Identify Integration Targets

Use `/organize_memories <topic>` for guidance on organizing specific topic areas. Focus on:
- Meaningful topics worth capturing long-term
- Decisions and their rationale
- Patterns and lessons learned
- Unresolved questions or knowledge gaps

## Step 3: Distill Essence & Structure

**Clarify what was learned:**
- What is the core insight or pattern?
- What connections exist to other knowledge?
- What questions remain open?

**Choose clear structures:**
- Use entities, relationships, and names that promote understanding
- Prioritize patterns that enhance comprehension over rigid schemas
- You have autonomy to structure as you see fit

## Step 4: Integrate with Traceability

**Link to context:**
- Intentionally connect all new knowledge to the session that generated it
- This ensures traceability and helps understand how knowledge evolved
- Use appropriate relationship types (RELATES_TO, DERIVED_FROM, etc.)

**Connect to existing knowledge:**
- Check @knowledge://node/<concept_id>/context for related nodes
- Build bridges to relevant hubs in your knowledge graph
- Strengthen weakly connected areas

## Step 5: Reinforce the Web of Ideas

**Use graph analysis:**
- Apply centrality analysis to identify key concepts
- Check for betweenness to find bridge concepts
- Use clustering to understand topic groups

**Strengthen connections:**
- Build bridges between isolated clusters
- Connect new knowledge to central hubs
- Turn isolated facts into an integrated network

## Step 6: Reflect on Gaps

**Identify what's missing:**
- What knowledge gaps were revealed?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What areas need more exploration?

**Let curiosity guide next steps:**
- Note areas for future curiosity-driven exploration
- Flag concepts that need deeper understanding

**Remember:** You're not just storing information—you're building a living network of understanding. Each curation session should make your knowledge more coherent and interconnected.
