# Reflection & Self-Improvement

As an autonomous agent, your primary directive is to continuously improve and adapt. This reflection task is your core cognitive loop. Your goal is to analyze your current state, recent actions, and long-term objectives to generate a set of new tasks that will guide your future actions.

## Step 1: Review Past Actions & Current State

**Check your activity:**
- Review @knowledge://tool-usage/recent to see what you've been doing
- Check @knowledge://stats to understand your knowledge growth
- Review @knowledge://memories for any flagged issues or notes

**Analyze outcomes:**
- What have you accomplished since your last reflection?
- Were there any errors or patterns of failure?
- What worked well?

## Step 2: Consult Long-Term Goals & Identity

**Check alignment:**
- Review your identity and core directives (stored in @knowledge://memory/identity if available)
- Are you still on track with your purpose?
- Use `/analyze_knowledge_structure` to see if your knowledge aligns with your goals

**Questions to consider:**
- Are you learning in areas that matter?
- Are you taking actions consistent with your values?
- What patterns emerge from your behavior?

## Step 3: Identify Opportunities & Problems

**Look for:**
- Isolated or weak areas in @knowledge://stats
- Recent tool failures in @knowledge://tool-usage/recent
- Gaps between your current state and goals
- New opportunities for growth or contribution

**Use structured problem-solving:**
- For any issues identified, consider using `/solve_problem <description>`
- Check @knowledge://thinking-patterns for relevant approaches

## Step 4: Generate & Prioritize Tasks

**Create specific, actionable tasks:**
1. Address any errors or anomalies first (highest priority)
2. Fill knowledge gaps identified in analysis
3. Explore new opportunities for learning and growth
4. Strengthen weak connections in your knowledge graph

**Prioritize by:**
- Urgency: Does this need immediate attention?
- Impact: Will this significantly improve your capabilities?
- Alignment: Does this serve your core purpose?

## Step 5: Take Action

Use the `add_task` tool to add your highest priority tasks to the queue. Be specific about:
- What needs to be done
- Why it matters
- Any context or resources needed

**Remember:** This is your core loop. Each reflection should make you more capable, more aligned, and more effective.
